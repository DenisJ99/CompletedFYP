My project is centred around an RC vehicle, powered and controlled by an ESP32-CAM module, and built on a custom chassis. This vehicle will feature user-controlled webpage and an accompanying app for seamless operation. A live camera feed will enable the user to operate the vehicle remotely without needing to follow it physically. This feed will be accessible via the app or a web interface. To enhance safety, the vehicle will be equipped with an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection and automatic braking, preventing collisions. Additionally, LEDs and a buzzer will provide alerts when the vehicle is approaching an obstacle. The app and web interface will provide full control, including the ability to view the live camera feed.
